        What is 32-Bit Operating System?
It is a CPU architecture type that holds the capacity to transfer 32 bits of data. It refers to the amount of data and information that your CPU can easily process when operating. A majority of the computers produced in the early 2000s and 1990s were 32-bit machines.

One bit in the register can typically reference an individual byte. Thus, the 32-bit system is capable of addressing about 4,294,967,296 bytes (4 GB) of RAM. Its actual limit is less than 3.5 GB (usually) because a portion of the register stores various other temporary values apart from the memory addresses.

<h1 id="opening">What is 64-Bit Operating System?</h1>
The 64-bit microprocessor allows computer systems to process information, data, and memory addresses represented by 64 bits. Such a system can typically reference 16 exabytes (17,179,869,184 GB), or 18,446,744,073,709,551,616 bytes of memory.

A 64-bit system (a computer with a 64-bit processor) can access more than 4 GB of RAM. It is numerous million times more than what an average workstation would require to access. It means that if a computer has 8 GB of RAM, it requires a 64-bit processor. Or else, the CPU will be inaccessible to at least 4 GB of the memory.
